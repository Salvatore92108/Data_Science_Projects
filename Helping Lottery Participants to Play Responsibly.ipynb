    "\n",
    "This project is about developing the logical core for an application that calculates winning probabilities for the [Canada 6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49) so that players can have fun responsibly and knowing exactly what their odds of winning are, possibly preventing and/or helping to treat lottery addiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 6/49 lottery game usually works this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- there are 49 numbers ranging from 1 to 49;\n",
    "- six numbers are drawn from this set; *there is usually a bonus number too, but we will not be considering it during this project*;\n",
    "- players win the big prize if all the numbers on their ticket match the numbers drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the course of the project we will build functions that allow users to answer questions like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- what is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "- what is the probability of winning the big prize playing n different tickets?\n",
    "- what is the probability of having at least n winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also consider [historical data](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) of Canada 49/6 lottery drawings between 1982 and 2018 to see which combinations of winning numbers have already occurred."
